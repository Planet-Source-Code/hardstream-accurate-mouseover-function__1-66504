## Accurate MouseOver function


</div>

### Description

This is probably the most accurate MouseOver function that doesn't need a handle (hWnd) input. It gets the rectangle of the control on the screen in pixels by looking to the position of the parent form and the position of the control in the form. The code also checks if the form has got a menu bar. Anywayz, just check out the code :D
 
### More Info
 
Obj As Object

True or False

Works most accurate with border style 2. I'm currently working on support for all border styles.
